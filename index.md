## Currently

`Since 2019`
**Red Hat |** Engineering Manager & Software Engineer

### Focused on

**Technical leadership and delivery**: Guide team of 5 engineers used to on-premise product to deliver SaaS microservice. The team owned the app fully with its operations, delivered it on time with 99.9% uptime. The team measured the success and later decided to decomission the service.

**Organizational Impact**: Guided team through few reorganizations. Ensured the culture of open decision-making and transparency across organizational levels. I've bridged many teams to talk together and collaborate effectively.

**Mentorship**: Mentor engineers in system design, open source contribution, and technical leadership. 


### Key Projects

**Full-Stack Product Delivery** *(console.redhat.com)*
Delivered complete product lifecycle: led 5-person team to build, launch, and maintain [open source](https://github.com/RHEnVision/) OS deployment service reaching production and [Red Hat Summit]((https://youtu.be/0LCmCkwRcOE?si=SfuSF-xitcVsNcCt&t=1695)) presentation within 12 months. Established success metrics, monitored adoption, and made strategic decision to deprecate when data showed limited traction.

**Architecture Refactoring** *(Foreman)*  
[Led upstream collaboration](https://community.theforeman.org/t/puppet-plugin-release-and-its-future/22335) to extract tightly-coupled Puppet code into standalone module, reducing Foreman core complexity while maintaining backward compatibility. Aligned Red Hat's product simplification goals with community needs, enabling optional adoption and reducing maintenance burden for both upstream and enterprise distributions.

## Previously

### Focused on
