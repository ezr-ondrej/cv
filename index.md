</p>

## Currently

`Since 2019`
**Red Hat |** Engineering Manager & Software Engineer

### Focused on

**Product delivery**: Built a console.redhat.com OS deployment service simplifying deployments of Cloud VMs.
Later guided the decision to take the service down again, when it didn't prove successful.

**Technical leadership**: Guide team of 5 engineers to shift from delivering self hosted product to deliver full-stack development for SaaS with 99.9% uptime.

**Organizational Impact**: Guided team through reorganizations to put backend, frontend and quality engineering to single team.
It helped stream-line decision making and simplify delivery process.

**Mentorship**: Mentor engineers in system design, open source contribution, and technical leadership. All the engineers I've led are regarded as high performers and great to collaborate with.

**Culture**: Champion open decision-making and transparency across organizational levels. Bridged many teams to talk together more and collaborate more closely.


### Key Projects

**Full-Stack Product Delivery** *(console.redhat.com)*
Delivered complete product lifecycle: led 5-person team to build, launch, and maintain [open source](https://github.com/RHEnVision/) OS deployment service reaching production and [Red Hat Summit]((https://youtu.be/0LCmCkwRcOE?si=SfuSF-xitcVsNcCt&t=1695)) presentation within 12 months. Established success metrics, monitored adoption, and made strategic decision to deprecate when data showed limited traction.

**Architecture Refactoring** *(Foreman)*  
[Led upstream collaboration](https://community.theforeman.org/t/puppet-plugin-release-and-its-future/22335) to extract tightly-coupled Puppet code into standalone module, reducing Foreman core complexity while maintaining backward compatibility. Aligned Red Hat's product simplification goals with community needs, enabling optional adoption and reducing maintenance burden for both upstream and enterprise distributions.

## Previously
`2016-2019`
**Ministry of Justice CZ |** Software Engineer

### Focused on

**Open Source Advocacy**: I've championed adoption of open source licenses within government software to improve collaboration between deparments and to reduce vendor dependency.

**DevOps modernization**: Transformed software delivery in traditionally rigid environment. Introduced modern CI/CD processes and quality assurance practices to reduce maintenance cost and improve oversight


### Key Project

[Established CI/CD pipelines](https://archiv.isss.cz/archiv/2020/do/watch?id=52) and quality assurance frameworks, modernizing government software delivery practices while pushing for [Open Sourcing projects](https://github.com/ministryofjusticecz).
