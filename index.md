<p id="summary">
Technical contributor and team enabler who helps build high-performing engineering teams through clear vision and open decision-making. 5+ years scaling infrastructure platforms at Red Hat, with deep expertise in open source development and community collaboration. I believe the best technical solutions emerge when engineers have autonomy, transparency, and shared purpose.
</p>

## Currently

`Since 2019`
**Red Hat |** Engineering Manager & Software Engineer

### Focused on

- **Product delivery**: Built a console.redhat.com OS deployment service simplifying deployments of Cloud VMs. Later guided the decision to take the service down again, when it didn't prove successful.
- **Technical leadership**: Guide team of 5 engineers to shift from delivering self hosted product to deliver full-stack development for SaaS with 99.9% uptime.
- **Organizational Impact**: Guided team through reorganizations to put backend, frontend and quality engineering to single team. Stream-line decision making and simplify delivery process.
- **Mentorship**: Mentor engineers in system design, open source contribution, and technical leadership. All the engineers I've led are regarded as high performers and great to collaborate with.
- **Culture**: Champion open decision-making and transparency across organizational levels. Bridged many teams to talk together more and collaborate more closely.


### Key Projects

**OS Deployment Tool** *(console.redhat.com)*
I've led team of five to built and deliver an [Open Source service](https://github.com/RHEnVision/) in a [SaaS product](https://console.redhat.com/). We've delivered it under a year, in time to present on a [main stage](https://youtu.be/0LCmCkwRcOE?si=SfuSF-xitcVsNcCt&t=1695). We've maitained it for a year and subsequentely decided to deprecate and remove when it didn't prove successful.

**Code to module extraction** *(Foreman)*  
[Collaborated with upstream communities](https://community.theforeman.org/t/puppet-plugin-release-and-its-future/22335) to align enterprise goal of removing code with open project roadmap by extracting code to a module while keeping both upstream and downstream delivery simple. This allowed to remove dependency for customers to simplify the deployment process while allowing community the choice of continue using it.

## Previously
`2016-2019`
**Ministry of Justice CZ |** Software Engineer

### Focused on

- **Open Source Advocacy**: Led adoption of open source licenses within government software to improve collaboration between deparments and reduce vendor dependency.
- **DevOps Implementation**: Introduced modern CI/CD processes and quality assurance practices to reduce maintenance cost and improve oversight
- **Modernization**: Transformed software delivery in traditionally rigid government environment
- **Process Innovation**: Started an in-house development department. Established foundation for developer autonomy and infrastructure transparency.


### Key Project

**DevOps Transformation**
[Established CI/CD pipelines](https://archiv.isss.cz/archiv/2020/do/watch?id=52) and quality assurance frameworks, modernizing government software delivery practices while pushing for [Open Sourcing some projects](https://github.com/ministryofjusticecz).
